## Mask-RCNN Training and Inference
1. Code for training and running inference with the Matterport implementation of Mask R-CNN can be found in this (mask_rcnn/MaskRCNN_TrainAndInference.ipynb). 
2. Please download and keep the mask-rcnn code from this link(https://github.com/ahmedfgad/Mask-RCNN-TF2) and keep inside the folder Mask-RCNN-TF2/

3. The example uses a cig-butt dataset that needs to be downloaded separately from here (https://www.immersivelimit.com/datasets/cigarette-butts) a sample for the same can be found in the datasets folder along with the json.
